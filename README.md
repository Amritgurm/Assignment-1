# source_code_optimization

We were provided a code and were given the task of "Refactoring" the current code. 

Under close observation we found that some of the class functions were repeating in style.css 
file so to make it easier we combined those classes to make one claass instead of 3 different classes.
We also found that the names of the classes didn't really represent the target area from the back-end 
so just to make it bit more readble in future, we renamed those classes as well. 


We have also removed some unused ID that were in the HTML code but were not defined in the Style.CSS
